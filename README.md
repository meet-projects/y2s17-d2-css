Y2 2017 Summer, Day 2: CSS Lab 1
- Make an html page with a header, two paragraphs, and at least one link. If your partner wasn’t here yesterday, teach them about the \<p\>, \<ul\>, and \<a\> tags.

- Create a new file called “style.css”. Inside, type

```
body {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white; 
}
```
- In your HTML file, add this somewhere inside the \<head\>:

    \<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=”style.css"\>

- Use coolors.co to pick a better colorscheme for this website. Change the colors based on your new scheme, but do not use the style attribute!
