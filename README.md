# Y2 2017 Summer, Day 2: CSS Lab 1

Before we begin, make sure to clone this repository as we did yesterday:

```
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/meet-projects/y2s17-d2-css.git
cd y2s17-d2-css
subl hello.html
```
1) Open hello.html and create a page with a header, two paragraphs, and at least one link. If your partner wasn’t here yesterday, teach them about the `<p>`, `<h3>`, and `<a>` tags.

2) Open style.css and create a style file such that the background color is blue and all text is white.

3) In your HTML file, add this somewhere inside the \<head\>:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=”style.css">
```
4) Use coolors.co to pick a better colorscheme for this website. Change the colors based on your new scheme, but do not use the style attribute!

1) To get checked off, make sure you’re using a good color scheme for all the colors!
2) Use a CSS tag selector to change the color of all links.
3) Add a list of six favorite foods to your website. If your partner wasn’t here yesterday, explain the <ul> and <ol> tags to them. Use CSS class selectors to make vegetarian foods one color and non-vegetarian foods a different color.
4) Use a CSS id selector to give one element on your page a different background color.
5) Using Google and/or w3schools, find out what the following properties do. To get checked off, show each of them off on your website and explain them to your TA.
- font-family
- font-size
- list-style-type
