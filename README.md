# Y2 2017 Summer, Day 2: CSS Lab 1

Before we begin, make sure to clone this repository as we did yesterday:

```
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/meet-projects/y2s17-d2-css.git
cd y2s17-d2-css
subl hello.html
```
1) Open hello.html and create a page with a header, two paragraphs, and at least one link. If your partner wasn’t here yesterday, teach them about the `<p>`, `<h3>`, and `<a>` tags.

2) Open style.css and create a style file such that the background color is blue and all text is white.

3) In your HTML file, add this somewhere inside the \<head\>:

    \<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=”style.css"\>

4) Use coolors.co to pick a better colorscheme for this website. Change the colors based on your new scheme, but do not use the style attribute!
